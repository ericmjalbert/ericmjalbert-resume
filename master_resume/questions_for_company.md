These are just general questions that I should ask during interviews, in order of general importance:

Soft Questions:
* What are the next expectations for the interview process
* What are the working hours like: flexible, 9-5, etc...
* What are the rules for working from home?
* Number of sick days / vacation days?
* Do they have an employee review process? what is it?
* Do they have a structured raise/promotion framework?
* How many teams do they have/how are they organized?

Hard Questions:
* Whats the tech stack like?
* What would I do on my first day?
* What's the biggest problem the team is working on now?
* What was the last "completed" project they finished?
* What is the setup they use to propogate analytics reports throughout the company?
* Do they use Github/Slack/Jira
* when does the team do code/analysis reviews
* Do they follow Kanban/Sprints/ etc..?
